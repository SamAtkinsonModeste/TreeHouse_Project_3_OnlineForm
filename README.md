## My Process
As this was my first web form, I started structuring the **HTML** with the help of the mobile mockup. However, seeing all the form elements in the browser as *inline soup* was a little intimidating. So I googled how to create a form and found an **MDN page**. Using the **MDN info**, I restructured my **HTML**, nesting my form elements within block level elements.
Once satisfied with my **HTML** structure, I started styling my page with **CSS**.

### Technoliges Used
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Semantic HTML5 form markup
- HTML5 Validation required attribute
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first layout

### What I learned
Nesting form elements with their respective label in block level elements makes changing layouts using media queries very easy when Flexbox is used on the block level elements.
By giving a **label** a **for** attribute and the respective **input** element an **id** with the same text value, it's very cool that you can click on the label for a checkbox or radio button to be activated.

### Continued Development
- Using less block level elements to nest the form elements.
- Adding JavaScript to a web form

### Resources
- [MDN - How To Structure a Web Form](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/How_to_structure_a_web_form) - The page that introduced me to structuring HTML with label and input elements nested in a block level element.
